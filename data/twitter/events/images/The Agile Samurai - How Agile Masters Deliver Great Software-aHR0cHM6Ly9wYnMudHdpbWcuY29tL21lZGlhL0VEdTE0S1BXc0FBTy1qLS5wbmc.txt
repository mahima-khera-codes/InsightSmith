##### Description

```markdown
This image displays a template specifically for writing user stories in agile development methodologies. It is structured as follows:

1. **Header Section:**
   - **Title:** Space to indicate a descriptive title for the user story, representing a specific feature or functionality.
   - **Priority:** Field to specify the urgency or importance of the user story relative to others.
   - **Estimate:** A placeholder to input the estimated effort (typically in story points) required to complete the user story.

2. **User Story Composition:**
   - **As a <type of user>:** Describes the role of the user, identifying the type of person (usually an end-user or stakeholder) interested in the feature.
   - **I want to <perform some task>:** States the task or action the user aims to accomplish.
   - **So that I can <achieve some goal>:** Clarifies the goal or benefit the user derives from performing the task.

3. **Acceptance Criteria Section:**
   - **Acceptance criteria** define the conditions that must be fulfilled for the user story to be considered complete.
   - **Given <some context>:** Describes the initial setup or context that must exist for the function to work as expected.
   - **When <some action is carried out>:** Specifies the action or event.
   - **Then <a set of observable outcomes should occur>:** Indicates the expected outcome, ensuring the system behaves as intended when the conditions are met.

This format is widely used in agile methodologies like Scrum to break work into actionable tasks while maintaining focus on the user experience and measurable success.
