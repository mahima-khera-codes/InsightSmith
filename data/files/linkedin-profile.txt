### Conference Talk: Principles of Code - Five Key Points to Better SystemsConference Talk: Principles of Code - Five Key Points to Better Systems

Jan 2023

Empower your development practices by embracing essential design principles from my CodeMash 2023 talk aimed at creating superior software systems. Start by prioritizing simple design; adhere to Kent Beck's rules by ensuring your code is clear, passes tests, and remains effortless to understand and maintain. Embrace the SOLID principles to build scalable and maintainable object-oriented software: assign only one responsibility per class, make objects extendable without modifications, allow seamless substitution of superclass objects with subclass ones, utilize interfaces judiciously to prevent unnecessary complexities, and depend on abstractions rather than concretions.

Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) to enhance reliability and robustness: begin with a failing test, write the minimum code needed to pass the test, and then refactor to optimize. Use the ZOMBIES strategy for problem-solving—approach complex problems incrementally to maintain clarity and manageability within your solutions. Finally, consistently apply the Boy Scout Rule: continuously improve the code's state each time you touch it, gradually reducing technical debt and enhancing the system's health.

### Conference Talk: Closing the Remote Engineering GapConference Talk: Closing the Remote Engineering Gap

Jun 2019

In my talk, I shared critical insights on transforming remote engineering teams into centers of productivity and creativity. As we embrace a remote-first work culture, it’s crucial to understand its inherent benefits, such as immense flexibility and access to a global talent pool. However, we also face challenges, like potential losses in communication nuances naturally present in a physical workspace.

My agenda was to empower teams to implement agile digital rituals, using robust communication tools such as Zoom, Tuple, Slack, and Trello, which help mirror the collaborative dynamism of in-person interactions. We discussed creating structured engagements and facilitating casual interactions to foster team cohesion and embed a strong sense of culture and community among remote workers.

Moreover, technology plays a pivotal role in this transition. By leveraging real-time collaboration tools, we maintain a continuous communication flow and ensure quick feedback loops essential for agile environments. It’s about transforming theoretical knowledge into practical applications that enhance our daily operations and interactions.

Leadership, too, transforms in remote environments. Adopting a servant leadership model and proactive management helps unlock the full potential of remote settings, ensuring that teams feel supported and valued.

The journey of adapting to a remote-first environment is ongoing. We learn from every interaction, tweak our strategies, and continuously seek to improve our approaches to meet evolving team dynamics and business needs. We can close the gap between remote and physical engineering teams by fostering an environment that promotes growth, learning, and adaptability, making geographical distances irrelevant to success.

### Meetup Presentation: Collaborative Python Programming w/ Visual Studio CodeMeetup Presentation: Collaborative Python Programming w/ Visual Studio Code

Oct 2018

In October 2018, as Visual Studio Code began making significant waves in the developer community, I had the pleasure of leading a groundbreaking session at the Cleveland Python Meetup titled "Collaborative Python Programming w/ Visual Studio Code". As an avid advocate for traditional coding methods, I introduced an innovative twist by employing VS Code's newly minted tool, the VS Live Share plugin. This plugin bridges geographical gaps and fosters unparalleled direct collaboration in the developer's environment.

The session focused on the famous "Fizz Buzz" problem—a coding challenge that effectively assesses a programmer's grasp of basic concepts despite its simplicity. What set this presentation apart was the collaborative approach in solving this challenge through Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. Participants, although initially reticent, were soon engrossed, thanks to the real-time interactive nature of VS Live Share.

Each participant could directly engage with the same codebase concurrently without setting up their environment, witnessing the immediate impact of their contributions. This enhanced learning and demonstrated the power of collaborative tools in real-world programming scenarios. As the session progressed, the initial timidity turned into enthusiastic participation, with every attendee eager to input their code.

The tools discussed, particularly VS Live Share, underscore a significant shift towards more collaborative and inclusive coding sessions. It was exhilarating to see participants transition from passive attendees to active contributors, truly embodying the spirit of communal learning and problem-solving.

### Lightning Talk: How to [Un]Successfully Run a Reading GroupLightning Talk: How to [Un]Successfully Run a Reading Group

Aug 2017

A lightning talk using humor and practical advice to communicate the enduring importance of continual learning for organizational culture.

I started the talk with a bit of humor, using the Derek Zoolander meme to point out that our formal education is just the beginning of our career learning journey. The meme featuring Goku transforming into a Super Saiyan was next, illustrating how tiny, consistent improvements can have monumental effects on our careers, transforming us from average engineers to legendary figures.

Shia LaBeouf's "Just Do It" meme drove home my next point: the best time to start a reading group is now. Then, I highlighted the importance of setting the right pace for learning, depending on group dynamics. I illustrated this with images of a speeding race car and a slow-moving turtle—emphasizing that learning speeds vary significantly among group members.

Another critical point was choosing the right time for meetings. I used the "It's Always Tea Time" meme from Alice in Wonderland to suggest that finding a perfect time depends on the group's preference—some might prefer lunchtime meetups, whereas others might find normal working hours more beneficial.

Promoting an inclusive atmosphere was crucial, too. I stressed that there should be no shaming for not reading the book—everyone is welcome anytime, and discussions can still be enriching for those who haven't caught up with the reading.

Lastly, the talk covered the best format for the reading group. I shared my experiences using a Tommy Boy meme about experimenting with different facilitation styles. Eventually, I discovered that a lean coffee style—allowing open and flowing conversations—fostered engaging discussions.

This talk provided a compact but comprehensive guide to fostering a culture of continuous improvement and collective empowerment through a technical reading group.

Aug 2016

In July 2016, I took a significant step in my professional journey by presenting at PyOhio, marking my first public speaking engagement. The talk, entitled "How to Create Your First PyPI Package", was also delivered at the CLEpy meetup in January 2017. This presentation introduced attendees to the Python Package Index (PyPI), highlighting its role as a cornerstone in Python's approach to distributing software.

As a first-time speaker, I sought to inform and inspire. I emphasized Python's "batteries included" philosophy, enriched by an extensive library of third-party packages that expand its native capabilities. The heart of my presentation was a straightforward, actionable guide to developing and distributing a Python package. From conceptualization based on a simple idea to the technical rigors of setting up Python, pip, and a virtual environment, I covered it all in accessible terms.

The highlight was a live demonstration, where I actively uploaded a simple package to PyPI. This wasn't just about showing code; it was about demonstrating the possibility and ease with which anyone can contribute to the Python ecosystem. This live demo underscored the practicality and immediate applicability of the talk, emphasizing the empowering feeling of making one's work publicly available with just a few commands.

Reflecting on this experience, the challenge of my first public presentation and the success of the live demo underscored an essential milestone in my career. It was a vivid illustration of how knowledge shared openly educates and builds the community.
