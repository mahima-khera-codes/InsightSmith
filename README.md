## Data and Knowledge Base

### Vector Store and Uploaded Data

Insight Genie's assistant utilizes a vector store to enhance its knowledge base, allowing for more informed and context-aware responses. This vector store is created by uploading various data files to the OpenAI API, which are then loaded into the assistant's vector store.

#### Types of Data Included

The assistant's vector store includes a rich set of data covering different aspects of software development, personal profiles, and event summaries. Here's a breakdown of the types of data integrated:

- **Product Definitions**:
  - `insight-genie-product-definition.txt`: Detailed descriptions of Insight Genie's features and capabilities.
- **Professional Profiles**:
  - `linkedin-profile.txt`: Professional experiences and skills from LinkedIn.
  - `persona.txt`: The persona behind Insight Genie, embodying Justin Beall's expertise.
  - `README.txt`: Comprehensive information about the project.
- **Books and Literature**:
  - `books.json`: A collection of books related to software development, agile methodologies, and leadership.
- **Code Summaries**:
  - `ai-assistant-manager.txt`: Summary of the `ai-assistant-manager` project.
  - `ai-code-summary.txt`: Summary of the `ai-code-summary` project.
  - `insight-genie.txt`: Summary of the Insight Genie codebase.
- **Event Summaries**:
  - `Event Summary - The Agile Samurai - How Agile Masters Deliver Great Software.txt`: Summaries and insights from specific events or books.

#### How It's Used

By incorporating these diverse data types into the vector store, the assistant can:

- Reference specific projects and codebases to provide detailed explanations or insights.
- Leverage personal profiles and personas to maintain consistency in tone and expertise.
- Utilize book summaries and event information to enrich conversations with relevant knowledge.
- Access a broader context when generating content, leading to more accurate and valuable responses.

#### Extensibility

This setup serves as an example of how various data can be integrated into the assistant. You can customize and extend the vector store by adding your own data files, such as:

- Company-specific documentation
- Additional code summaries
- Industry reports or whitepapers
- Personalized content relevant to your needs

By doing so, you can tailor Insight Genie to better suit your domain and enhance the assistant's effectiveness.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Insight Genie on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 or higher**: Ensure you have the correct Python version installed. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DEV3L/insight-genie.git
   cd insight-genie
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   Copy the `env.local` file to `.env` and replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key:

   ```bash
   cp env.local .env
   ```

3. **Install Hatch:**

   Insight Genie uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) for environment management and packaging.

   ```bash
   pip install hatch
   ```

4. **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   hatch env create
   hatch shell
   ```

   This will create and activate a virtual environment and install all project dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage

### Running the Chat Interface

Start interacting with Insight Genie using the chat interface:

```bash
hatch run chat
```

This command runs the `run_chat.py` script, which initializes the assistant and starts a chat session.

### Building the Assistant

If you need to build or rebuild the assistant (e.g., after updating the persona or prompt), run:

```bash
hatch run build
```

This command executes the `run_build.py` script to set up the assistant.

### Generating Code Summaries

To generate a markdown summary of your codebase using `ai-code-summary`, run:

```bash
hatch run summary .
```

This will create a comprehensive markdown file (`ai-code-summary.md`) summarizing your code, which can be used within Insight Genie or for documentation purposes.

### Processing Twitter Events

To process Twitter data and generate event-based insights, run:

```bash
hatch run process-twitter-events
```

This script processes tweets, extracts events, and generates markdown summaries with image descriptions and author information.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Insight Genie includes comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.

- **Unit Tests** (excluding integration tests):

  ```bash
  hatch run test
  ```

- **Integration Tests** (including tests that hit external systems):

  ```bash
  hatch run test-integration
  ```

### Coverage Reports

Generate coverage reports to assess test coverage:

```bash
hatch run test -- --cov
```

For coverage gutters (useful with code editors like VSCode):

```bash
hatch run test -- --cov --cov-report lcov
# In your editor, activate coverage gutters to visualize code coverage.
```

### Static Type Checking

Run static type checking with Pyright:

```bash
hatch run pyright
```
